GBX.NET is a GameBox (.Gbx) file parser library written in C# for .NET software framework. This file type can be seen in many of the Nadeo games like TrackMania, ShootMania or Virtual Skipper.

- GBX.NET can recognize **entire GBX files**, however **can't read all of the possible files**. GBX file is basically a serialized class from the GameBox engine, and all of these classes must be known to read. This is where you can help contributing to the project, by exploring new chunks. How to do it will be documented soon.
- GBX.NET can write GBX files which can be read by the parser, however this may not apply to all readable GBXs.
- All versions of GBX are supported: ranging from TM1.0 to TMÂ®.
- Reading PAK file isn't currently supported.

## Compatibility

GBX.NET is compatible with **.NET Standard 2.0** since version 0.2.0. Earlier versions are built on .NET Standard 2.1.

The library is also set to x86 assembly due to LZO compression problems in x64. It is unsure whenever this will be resolved.

## Dependencies

### GBX.NET
- SharpZipLib.NETStandard
- System.Drawing.Common

#### 0.1.0+
- Microsoft.CSharp

### GBX.NET.Json
- Newtonsoft.Json

## Usage

To parse a GBX with a known type:

```cs
var gbx = GameBox.Parse<CGameCtnChallenge>("MyMap.Map.Gbx");
// Node data is available in gbx.MainNode
```

To parse a GBX with an unknown type:

```cs
var gbx = GameBox.Parse("MyMap.Map.Gbx");

if (gbx is GameBox<CGameCtnChallenge> gbxMap)
{
    // Node data is available in gbxMap.MainNode
}
else if (gbx is GameBox<CGameCtnReplayRecord> gbxReplay)
{
    // Node data is available in gbxReplay.MainNode
}
```
